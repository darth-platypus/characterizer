# characterizer
Generate fictional characters with physical traits and personalities randomly selected according to user-specified templates. Exports in raw Markdown format.

## Usage

* Choose an existing character archetype dictionary from archetypes.py (currently available options are 'standard' or 'antagonist')
* Open main.py
* Find the line: characterize('Example', 'Character', 'Female', archetype=arch.standard)
* Modify with desired first name, last name, gender and archetype name.
* Save changes and run main.py (python3 main.py)
* Copy raw Markdown output from console.

## Notes / Future Plans

1) This is my first solo project after completing the Python course on Codecademy.com.
2) I'll make usage more user-friendly at some point in the near future. It definitely needs user-input to be done without editing files, and output should be in a file rather than console. One thing at a time!
